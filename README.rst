paperweight
===========

Python package for hacking LaTeX documents (extracted from `preprint <http://github.com/jonathansick/preprint>`_).

``paperweight`` operates on LaTeX documents either on the local filesystem, or as a commit in a git repository.
``paperweight`` can be used to manipulate documents, such as embedded input files and bibliographies, or can provide analytics such as rich information about references made in a document.
