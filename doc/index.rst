Paperweight
===========

Paperweight is a Python package for hacking LaTeX documents.

Paperweight operates on LaTeX documents either on the local filesystem, or as a commit in a git repository.
Paperweight can be used to manipulate documents, such as embedded input files and bibliographies, or can provide analytics such as rich information about references made in a document.
See the API documentation below for further information.

Paperweight is `developed on GitHub <http://github.com/jonathansick/paperweight>`_ under an open BSD license.
